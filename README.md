# Course Tracker (Senior Project)

## Description

My senior project is a course tracker/planner meant as a streamlined, easy-to-use version of other methods of course planning like DegreeWorks and Excel spreadsheets.  I am using the Angular framework and TypeScript for the front-end and Google Firebase for the backend and web app hosting.
